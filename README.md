# MS-Dhoni-Batting-Analysis-in-IPL
Is MS Dhoni still good enough to bat in middle order? 
As per the recent IPL 2022 data MS Dhoni has been compared with other Middle Order wicket-keeper batsmen to see where he stands in order to find out if he is good enough to bat.
Runs scored and strike rate is considered with minimum 180 balls faced i.e min 13 balls per match if they play 14 matches.
Now, the comparison is narrrowed to 6 wicket keeper batsmen.
As per the stats we can see that MS Dhoni has faced 198 balls and scored 232 runs at a strike rate of 117.17
Dhoni ranks last in terms of runs scored as well as in terms of strike rate amongst the 6 batsmen which is pretty low.
So it can be concluded that MS Dhoni is not good enough as a batsman anymore.
But MS Dhoni has long been hailed as one of the finest finishers in IPL history. However, concerns arose over his recent form and fitness due to a knee injury and subsequent surgery. Over the past four years, his scoring rate and strike rate appeared to dwindle. Nonetheless, in 2023, despite batting lower in the order due to his injury, Dhoni showcased his prowess by registering a remarkable strike rate of 182.45, scoring 104 runs off just 57 deliveries, including 10 big sixes. The following year, in 2024, he continued to defy expectations, smashing 110 runs off 48 deliveries with a scintillating strike rate of 229.16, embellished with 9 towering sixes. These performances reaffirm Dhoni's status as the premier finisher in the IPL. Notably, his record-breaking tally of 66 sixes in the 20th over exemplifies his ability to seize victory from the jaws of defeat.
